# Batchcamp

It's Bandcamp Friday. You just bought the whole Shall Not Fade discography and now you're sitting there opening each individual release in a new tab, waiting for the spinny thing to show the download link, clicking the link, going to the next tab, waiting for the spinny thing, whoops, you are trying to download too many at once so here’s an error.

Now you have to wait until a few finish before starting more. Going back to your tabs, waiting for the spinny thing, clicking download. You don’t have time for this, you have a set at the Student Union tonight and need to fill your USB with cheeky Speed Garage edits of Pop tunes. 

“If only there was a better way”, you cry to yourself softly, tears rolling down your cheeks. 

## Features
- Multi-select using Shift+Click
- Automatic download management with customizable concurrency

## Setup

*Chrome Web Store is pending, for now you will have to build from the source code directly*

To build from source

```
npm install
npm run build
```

Then add to Chrome by following the instructions for [loading an unpacked extension](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/#unpacked) and load the `dist` folder from the build step.
